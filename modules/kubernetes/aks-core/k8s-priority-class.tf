# Priority classes allows pods to be scheduled before other pods and evict pods from nodes.
# There are two types of priority classes, platform and tenant. All platform priority classes
# should have a higher priority value than the tenant priority classes. The platform-high
# class is not set to the maximum value on purpose, as to leave space to create even more
# prioritized classes in the future. It is preferred to use these classes rather than
# system-cluster-critical and system-node-critical as they are used by AKS critical pods
# which should have higher priority.
#
# Hot tip if you want to list all pods and their priority class in a cluster.
# `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o custom-columns=NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,PRIORITY:.spec.priorityClassName`
#
# TODO (Philip): Set preemptionPolicy when availible in the kubernetes provider.
